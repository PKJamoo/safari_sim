WORK IN PROGRESS

Simple Generational Genetics Algorithm using Neural Networks with a safari theme.

Future Versions:
  More Fauna Types (Predator/Prey Relationships, Water Fauna)
  Thirst Mechanisms
  Death Mechanisms (w/ Predators mentioned above)
     -- Examination of Gazelle network inputs.
      - Gazelle do not deal well with water.
    - Gazelle must track their food sources and weigh that accordingly.
   -- changes to Flora spawn mechanics.
      - ???

IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

V0.2: --Generational Algorithm - Fittest 'Fauna' are paired with each other, followed by next most fit pair and so on. - Each has some number of offspring to fill out the next generation.

V0.1:
  Implementation of Neural Network with one 'fauna' type.
  Note: They seem quite stupid.
