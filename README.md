WORK IN PROGRESS

Simple Generational Genetics Algorithm using Neural Networks with a safari theme.

V0.1:
  Implementation of Neural Network with one 'fauna' type.
  Note: They seem quite stupid.
  
Pending Features for V0.2:
   --Generational Algorithm
      - Fittest 'Fauna' are paired with each other, followed by next most fit pair and so on.
      - Each has 4 offspring to fill out the next generation.
   -- Examination of Gazelle network inputs.
   	  - Gazelle do not deal well with water.
	  - Gazelle must track their food sources and weigh that accordingly.
   -- changes to Flora spawn mechanics.
   	  - ???

Future Versions:
	More Fauna Types (Predator/Prey Relationships, Water Fauna)
	Thirst Mechanisms
	Death Mechanisms (w/ Predators mentioned above)
