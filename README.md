WORK IN PROGRESS

Simple Generational Genetics Algorithm using Neural Networks with a safari theme.

V0.1:
  Implementation of Neural Network with one 'fauna' type.
  Note: They seem quite stupid.
  
  Features for V0.2:
   --Generational Algorithm
      - Fittest 'Fauna' are paired with each other, followed by next most fit pair and so on.
      - Each has 4 offspring to continue the next generation.
   -- Examination of Gazelle network inputs. (increased/decreased randomization)
   -- changes to Flora spawn mechanics.
